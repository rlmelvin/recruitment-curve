# Suggest some journals that might be interested. I was thinking ASA monitor, but maybe something else.

Certainly! While **ASA Monitor** is a strong choice for reaching the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) membership and is well-regarded for its practical and timely content, there are several other journals that might be interested in your model of anesthesiology recruitment, particularly if you are aiming for broader academic or international impact[^1][^2][^3].
